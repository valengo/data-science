*I'm interested in data science because it's a very fascinating field that allows for lots of exploration to get insights to solve real world problems.*  
*I really enjoy data visualization. Who doesn't like a race bar plot?*

<h3>The following code prints a message for who is reading this notebook:</h3>

    Hello. I hope you're doing well! 😀


<strong>Three facts about me, one of them is a lie.</strong>
1. I can solve the rubik's cube in less than 1 minute
2. I have a streak of more than 365 days on Duolingo
3. I play dota 2 for almost 10 years

This funcionality of adding a collapsible section is very cool. The code I used to hide which fact was not true is like:

    <details>
        <summary><strong>Which of three facts is a lie? <u>Click here to reveal it.</u></strong></summary>
             Not revealing anything here to avoid spoilers 😅
    </details>

This gave me an idea of a little game that's totally based on luck.  
Can you guide the car (🚕) till one of the flags without falling into any holes (🕳)?  
On the table bellow, click on the dots (....) to reveal the path. Good luck!
